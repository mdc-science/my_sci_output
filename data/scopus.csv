The plant age is a parameter that can influence the chemical composition of the essential oil, as well as its pharmacological potential. For this purpose, essential oils from aerial parts of V. curassavica produced at different ages (4, 10, 14 and 18 months-age) were used. According to chromatograms obtained by GC-MS, the essential oils were mainly composed of α-pinene, trans-caryophyllene, α-santalene, alloaromadendrene and α-humulene. The chemical composition of V. curassavica essential oils varied qualitatively and quantitatively with the aging of the plants, and the essential oils from plants at 18 month-age appeared to be the most distinct from the others. The tested essential oil samples showed inhibitory activity against Candida albicans (MIC = 1000 µg/mL) but did not show antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria. The cytotoxic activity levels against the murine macrophages varied among the oils extracted from the plants at different ages; the IC50 values of the essential oils increased with age (171.90 µg/mL at 18 month-age). More studies should be carried out to assess whether age also affects the therapeutic effects of essential oils, resulting in the manufacture of plant-derived formulations that balance production costs, toxicity and therapeutic effects. © 2023 by the authors.","antifungal; Cordia verbenacea; cytotoxicity; essential oil; GC/MS; medicinal plant","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149150962"

Although most of them have common characteristics, differences in AMP sequences allow a huge repertoire of biological activity with varying degrees of efficacy. We present the first study of the AMPs from Pleurodema somuncurence (Anura: Leptodactylidae: Leiuperinae). Among the 11 identified mature peptides, three presented antimicrobial activity. Somuncurin-1 (FIIWPLRYRK), somuncurin-2 (FILKRSYPQYY), and thaulin-3 (NLVGSLLGGILKK) inhibited Escherichia coli growth. Somuncurin-1 also showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Biophysical membrane model studies revealed that this peptide had a greater permeation effect in prokaryotic-like membranes and capacity to restructure liposomes, suggesting fusogenic activity, which could lead to cell aggregation and disruption of cell morphology. This study contributes to the characterization of peptides with new sequences to enrich the databases for the design of therapeutic agents. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of investing in nature conservation and the power of genetic description as a strategy to identify new compounds.

Based on biorational strategies, many studies have investigated the cutaneous secretion of anurans as a source of bioactive molecules. By a peptidomic approach, a novel antioxidant peptide (AOP) with in vitro free radical scavenging ability was isolated from Physalaemus nattereri. The AOP, named antioxidin-I, has a molecular weight [M+H]                             +                              = 1543.69 Da and a TWYFITPYIPDK primary amino acid sequence. The gene encoding the antioxidin-I precursor was expressed in the skin tissue of three other Tropical frog species: Phyllomedusa tarsius, P. distincta and Pithecopus rohdei. cDNA sequencing revealed highly homologous regions (signal peptide and acidic region). Mature antioxidin-I has a novel primary sequence with low similarity compared with previously described amphibian's AOPs. Antioxidin-I adopts a random structure even at high concentrations of hydrophobic solvent, it has poor antimicrobial activity and poor performance in free radical scavenging assays in vitro, with the exception of the ORAC assay. However, antioxidin-I presented a low cytotoxicity and suppressed menadione-induced redox imbalance when tested with fibroblast in culture. In addition, it had the capacity to substantially attenuate the hypoxia-induced production of reactive oxygen species when tested in hypoxia exposed living microglial cells, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role for this peptide.                          © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Amphibia; Antioxidant peptide; Antioxidin; Microglia; Reactive oxygen species; Skin secretion","Amphibian Proteins; Animals; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Antioxidants; Anura; Bacterial Infections; Cloning, Molecular; Fibroblasts; Free Radical Scavengers; Mice; Microglia; Molecular Structure; Neuroprotection; NIH 3T3 Cells; Oxidation-Reduction; Protein Conformation; Reactive Oxygen Species; Skin; antioxidin I; antioxidin RP1; menadione; peptide; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; amphibian protein; antimicrobial cationic peptide; antioxidant; reactive oxygen metabolite; scavenger; amino acid sequence; animal cell; antibacterial activity; antioxidant activity; Anura; Article; cell hypoxia; cell viability; computer model; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug isolation; drug purification; drug structure; drug synthesis; embryo; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; fibroblast culture; human; human cell; in vitro study; microglia; minimum bactericidal concentration; minimum inhibitory concentration; molecular weight; mouse; neuroprotection; nonhuman; ORAC assay; oxidation reduction state; peptidomics; Phyllomedusa distincta; Phyllomedusa tarsius; Physalaemus nattereri; Pithecopus rohdei; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; animal; bacterial infection; chemical structure; fibroblast; genetics; immunology; metabolism; molecular cloning; NIH 3T3 cell line; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; protein conformation; skin","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034997591"

We found that Pithecopus azureus secretes a single peptide ([M + H]+ = 658.38 Da) at the developmental stage that precedes the onset of terrestrial behaviour. De novo peptide and cDNA sequencing revealed that the peptide, named PaT-2, is expressed in tandem and is a member of the tryptophyllins family. In silico studies allowed us to identify the position of reactive sites and infer possible antioxidant mechanisms of the compounds. Cell-based assays confirmed the predicted antioxidant activity in mammalian microglia and neuroblast cells. The potential neuroprotective effect of PaT-2 was further corroborated in FRET-based live cell imaging assays, where the peptide prevented lipopolysaccharide-induced ROS production and glutamate release in human microglia. In summary, PaT-2 is the first peptide expressed during the ontogeny of P. azureus, right before the metamorphosing froglet leaves the aquatic environment to occupy terrestrial habitats. The antioxidant activity of PaT-2, predicted by in silico analyses and confirmed by cell-based assays, might be relevant for the protection of the skin of P. azureus adults against increased O 2 levels and UV exposure on land compared with aquatic environments. © 2021 The Author(s).","Amphibia; antioxidant peptide; MALDI mass spectrometry imaging; oxidative stress; Pithecopus azureus; tryptophyllin","Animals; Antioxidants; Anura; Humans; Mammals; Peptides; Skin; Water; Amphibia; Mammalia; antioxidant; peptide; water; antioxidant; aquatic environment; developmental stage; frog; ontogeny; peptide; physiology; secretion; animal; Anura; human; mammal; physiology; skin","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119997100"

Since treatment for this disease relies only on the use of praziquantel, there is an urgent need to identify new antischistosomal drugs. Piplartine is an amide alkaloid found in several Piper species (Piperaceae) that exhibits antischistosomal properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the structure–function relationship between piplartine and its five synthetic analogues (19A, 1G, 1M, 14B and 6B) against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms, as well as its cytotoxicity to mammalian cells using murine fibroblast (NIH-3T3) and BALB/cN macrophage (J774A.1) cell lines. In addition, density functional theory calculations and in silico analysis were used to predict physicochemical and toxicity parameters. Bioassays revealed that piplartine is active against S. mansoni at low concentrations (5–10 µM), but its analogues did not.

In the 1990s, various studies revealed that activities of antioxidant enzymes rose in animals under hypometabolic conditions. These timely observations allowed scientists to propose that this increase could prepare animals for reoxygenation events following the release of oxygen restriction, but in doing so, would trigger oxidative damage, hence the use of the term “preparation”. Over next 25 years, the phenomenon was described in detail in more than one hundred studies of animals under conditions of aestivation, hypoxia/anoxia, freezing, severe dehydration, ultraviolet exposure, air exposure of water-breathing animals, salinity stress, and others. The POS phenomenon remained without a mechanistic explanation until 2013, when it was proposed that a small increase in oxyradical formation during hypoxia exposure (in hypoxia-tolerant animals) could activate redox-sensitive transcription factors that, in turn, would initiate transcription and translation of antioxidant enzymes. Dr. Lushchak, who studied goldfish under severe hypoxia in the 1990s, had actually proposed the increased production of oxyradicals under this condition and concluded that it would lead to an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, the hallmark of the POS strategy. However, his research partner at the time, Dr. Hermes-Lima, thought the idea did not have sufficient evidence to support it and recommended the removal of this explanation. In those days, the main line of thinking was that increased oxyradical formation under hypoxia was “impossible”. So, as it turns out, the ideas of Dr. Lushchak were well ahead of his time. It then took >10 years before the biochemical and molecular mechanisms responsible for triggering the POS response were clarified. In the present article, this fascinating history is described to highlight Dr. Lushchak's contributions and insights about the POS theory. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Antioxidant; Hormesis; Hypoxia; Oxygen; Reactive oxygen species; Redox biology","Animals; Antioxidants; Hypoxia; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Reactive Oxygen Species; antioxidant; enzyme; radical; transcription factor; antioxidant; oxygen; reactive oxygen metabolite; aestivation; air; anoxia; antioxidant activity; biologist; dehydration; exposure; freezing; goldfish; human; hypoxia; nonhuman; Note; oxidative stress; physiological stress; publication; radiation exposure; reoxygenation; salt stress; theory; ultraviolet radiation; upregulation; animal; metabolism; physiology","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142310392"

Fractions of whey metal-binding peptides (Cu, Fe, and Zn) isolated by immobilized metal affinity chromatography showed different amino acid profiles according to the metal. The Cu-binding peptides presented roughly twofold increase in the in vitro antioxidant, as assessed by oxygen radical absorbance capacity and anticholinesterase activities over the hydrolysate. This is probably because of the higher concentration of aromatic and basic residues, the latter being crucial for binding to the anionic sites of acetylcholinesterase. Six peptide sequences were synthesized based on the metal-binding sites, molecular mass, hydrophobicity, and bioactivity probability. Among the synthetic peptides, the VF dipeptide stood out both for its in vitro antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities.

Under conditions such as hypoxia/anoxia, temperature and salinity stress, or seasonal changes (e.g. hibernation, estivation), stress-tolerant species down-regulate pathways to decrease energy expenditures until the return of less challenging conditions. However, it is with the return of these more favorable conditions and the reactivation of basal metabolic rates that a strong increase of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) occurs, leading to oxidative stress. Over the last few decades, cases of species capable of enhancing antioxidant defenses during hypometabolic states have been reported across taxa and in response to a variety of stressors. Interpreted as an adaptive mechanism to counteract RONS formation during tissue hypometabolism and reactivation, this strategy was coined “Preparation for Oxidative Stress” (POS). Laboratory experiments have confirmed that over 100 species, spanning 9 animal phyla, apply this strategy to endure harsh environments. However, the challenge remains to confirm its occurrence in the natural environment and its wide applicability as a key survival element, through controlled experimentation in field and in natural conditions. Under such conditions, numerous confounding factors may complicate data interpretation, but this remains the only approach to provide an integrative look at the evolutionary aspects of ecophysiological adaptations. In this review, we provide an overview of representative cases where the POS strategy has been demonstrated among diverse species in natural environmental conditions, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of these results and conclusions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptation; Antioxidant defenses; Environmental stress; Hypometabolism; Oxidative stress","Animals; Antioxidants; Environment; Hypoxia; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Reactive Nitrogen Species; Reactive Oxygen Species; oxygen; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; antioxidant; oxygen; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; adaptation; anoxia; antioxidant activity; Anura; basal metabolic rate; Brazil; China; environment; environmental stress; fish; Greece; hibernation; hypoxia; mollusc; nonhuman; oxidative stress; Review; Russian Federation; salt stress; seasonal variation; Serbia; snake; Stylommatophora; temperature; turtle; animal; metabolism; physiology","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188926329"

The upregulation of antioxidants during oxygen-limiting conditions, such as intertidal aerial exposure (AE), is known as preparation for oxidative stress (POS). Preparation for oxidative stress has been commonly reported for animals exposed to hypoxia in the lab, but few studies have investigated it under ecologically relevant natural settings. Here, we studied metabolic enzymes, antioxidants, and oxidative stress markers in Brachidontes solisianus mussels exposed to a natural tidal cycle in a rocky beach in Southern Brazil. Animals were collected at 6 time-points throughout the tidal cycle: after 2 h of AE; then after 1 h, 3 h, and 7 h of immersion; followed by 0.5 h and 4 h of AE. The activities of malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase were unaffected by aerial exposure. Similarly, the acitivities of enzymes of the antioxidant system, catalase, glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase did not change significantly throughout the tidal cycle. In contrast, total and reduced glutathione levels significantly increased at 4 h AE by 47% and 64%, respectively, compared with those in submerged mussels (1 h, 3 h, and 7 h immersion groups combined). Lipid peroxidation and carbonyl protein levels significantly increased after 4 h of AE compared with those in mussels underwater for 7 h. Our results indicate the occurrence of POS in B. solisianus mussels exposed to air under natural conditions during tidal cycles. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aerial exposure; Antioxidant; Bivalve; Hypoxia; Reactive oxygen species; Ultraviolet radiation","Brazil; Bivalvia; Brachidontes; Invertebrata; air temperature; anoxic conditions; antioxidant; beach; bivalve; enzyme activity; glucose; intertidal environment; lipid; metabolism; oxidative stress; phosphate; protein; redox conditions; rocky shore; solar radiation; tidal cycle; tide","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106863658"

In vitro assays using human microglia and red blood cells showed that salamandrin-I has no cytotoxicity up to the concentration of 100 µM. In addition, in vivo toxicity tests on Galleria mellonella larvae resulted in no mortality at 20 and 40 mg/kg. Antioxidant peptides derived from natural sources are increasingly attracting interest.

Extracts prepared with lyophilized pulps from fruits obtained in local markets were analyzed individually to evaluate the extent of antioxidant protection and investigate the antioxidant mechanism. Iron-mediated hydroxylation of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pirrolidine-N-oxide, determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and oxidative degradation of 2-deoxyribose (2-DR) were inhibited by fruit extracts in a dose-dependent manner. There was a considerable individual variability in inhibition of 2-DR degradation by individual fruits. Higher protection of 2-DR degradation (by the extracts) was observed in Fe(III)-citrate/ascorbate in comparison with Fe(III)-EDTA/ascorbate system; however, antioxidant effectiveness of fruit extracts was not diminished by increasing EDTA concentration by 10-fold. Other competition experiments using the 2-DR assay (varying pre-incubation time and 2-DR concentration) indicated that protection comes mainly from free radical scavenging, rather that metal chelation antioxidant activity. Persimmon extracts prevented iron-mediated lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenates, which correlated significantly with the inhibition of 2-DR oxidation. Finally, sugar content of individual fruits correlated inversely with inhibition of 2-DR degradation, which could indicate that maturation decreases soluble antioxidant concentration or efficiency. In conclusion, lipid peroxidation, 2-DR and EPR experiments indicated that extracts from commercial fruits showed mainly radical-scavenger activity and relevant antioxidant activity. © 2018 Dalvi et al.","Fruit maturation; Lipid peroxidation; Oxidative stress; Polyphenol; Tannin","2 deoxyribose; ascorbic acid; chelating agent; citrate sodium; Diospyros kaki extract; edetic acid; ellagic acid; ferric chloride; hydrogen; malonaldehyde; phosphoric acid; plant extract; tannin; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; unclassified drug; analysis of variance; antioxidant activity; Article; astringency; Brazil; centrifugation; cervical spine dislocation; chemical phenomena; chronic disease; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; degradation; electron spin resonance; enzyme structure, function and variability; free radical scavenging assay; frequency analysis; genetic variability; IC50; in vitro propagation; incubation temperature; light dark cycle; lipid peroxidation assay; maturation; nonhuman; nutrition; oxidation; persimmon; phonetics; skin maceration; spectroscopy; temperature","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050637755"

This tropical/subtropical reptile enter a state of dormancy, with an 80% reduction in metabolic rate, that remains almost constant during winter. The redox metabolism in non-mammalian vertebrates that hibernate under such distinguished conditions is poorly understood. We analyzed the redox metabolism in the intestine of juvenile tegus during different stages of their first annual cycle. The effect of food deprivation (in spring) was also studied to compare with fasting during hibernation. Both winter dormancy and food deprivation caused decreases in reduced glutathione levels and glutathione transferase activity. While glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase activities decreased during winter dormancy, as well as glutathione (GSH) levels, other antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase) remained unchanged. Notably, levels of disulfide glutathione (GSSG) were 2.1-fold higher in late autumn, when animals were in the process of depressing metabolism towards hibernation. This increased ""oxidative tonus"" could be due to a disruption in NADPH-dependent antioxidant systems. In dormancy, GSSG and lipid hydroperoxides were diminished by 60-70%. The results suggest that the entrance into hibernation is the main challenge for the redox homeostasis in the intestine of juvenile tegus. © 2018 The Author(s).","","Animals; Antioxidants; Catalase; Energy Metabolism; Glutathione; Glutathione Disulfide; Glutathione Peroxidase; Glutathione Reductase; Intestinal Mucosa; Lizards; Oxidation-Reduction; antioxidant; catalase; glutathione; glutathione disulfide; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; animal; energy metabolism; intestine mucosa; lizard; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048951203"

Herein, a SEDDS loaded with lycopene purified from red guava (nanoLPG) was produced. The nanoemulsion was characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential measurement, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), lycopene content quantification, radical scavenging activity and colloidal stability in cell culture medium. Then, in vivo toxicity and tissue distribution in orally treated mice and cytotoxicity on human prostate carcinoma cells (DU-145) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were evaluated. Results: NanoLPG exhibited physicochemical properties with a size around 200 nm, negative zeta-potential, and spherical morphology. The size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential parameters suffered insignificant alterations during the 12 month storage at 5 °C, which were associated with lycopene stability at 5 °C for 10 months. The nanoemulsion showed partial aggregation in cell culture medium at 37 °C after 24 h. NanoLPG at 0.10 mg/mL exhibited radical scavenging activity equivalent to 0.043 ± 0.002 mg Trolox/mL. The in vivo studies did not reveal any significant changes in clinical, behavioral, hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in mice orally treated with nanoLPG at 10 mg/kg for 28 days. In addition, nanoLPG successfully delivered lycopene to the liver, kidney and prostate in mice, improved its cytotoxicity against DU-145 prostate cancer cells—probably by pathway independent on classical necrosis and apoptosis—and did not affect PBMC viability. Conclusions: Thus, nanoLPG stands as a promising and biosafe lycopene delivery system for further development of nanotechnology-based health products.

Salamandrin-I is an antioxidant peptide, isolated from the skin secretion of the fire salamander, that has induced no toxicity in microglia or erythrocytes. Importantly, the administration of antioxidants may constitute an adequate therapeutic approach to cancer treatment. Here, with the purpose of better characterizing the therapeutic potential of salamandrin-I, we investigated whether this antioxidant peptide also exerts anticancer activity, using the human leukemia cell line HL-60 as a cancer model. Salamandrin-I treatment induced a significant reduction in HL-60 proliferation, which was accompanied by cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the peptide-induced cell death showed a significant increase in the LDH release in HL-60 cells. The cellular toxicity exerted by salamandrin-I is possibly related to pyroptosis, since the HL-60 cells showed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and hyperexpression of inflammasome components following the peptide treatment. This is the first demonstration of the anticancer potential of the salamandrin-I peptide. Such results are important, as they offer relevant insights into the field of cancer therapy and allow the design of future bioactive molecules using salamandrin-I as a template. © 2023 by the authors.","antioxidant peptide; HL-60; leukemia; pyroptosis; salamandrin-I","antimitotic agent; cryopyrin; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; lactate dehydrogenase; salamandrin I; unclassified drug; antiproliferative activity; Article; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug determination; drug effect; enzyme activation; enzyme release; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression profiling; HL-60 cell line; human; human cell; mitochondrial membrane potential; protein expression; pyroptosis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166343272"

This is the first time a tryptophyllin is identified in snake venom. We tested whether BmT-2 had cytotoxic effects and antioxidant activity in a set of experiments that included both in vitro and cell-based assays. BmT-2 presented a radical scavenging activity toward ABTS• and AAPH-derived radicals. BmT-2 protected fluorescein, DNA molecules, and human red blood cells (RBCs) from free radicals generated by the thermal decomposition of AAPH. The novel tryptophyllin was not toxic in cell viability tests, where it (up to 0.4 mg/mL) did not cause hemolysis of human RBCs and did not cause significant loss of cell viability, showing a CC50 > 1.5 mM for cytotoxic effects against SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cells. BmT-2 prevented the arsenite-induced upregulation of Nrf2 in Neuro-2a neuroblasts and the phorbol myristate acetate-induced overgeneration of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species in SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cells. Electronic structure calculations and full atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations revealed the relevant contribution of aromatic residues in BmT-2 to its antioxidant properties. Our study presents a novel peptide classified into the family of the tryptophyllins, which has been reported exclusively in amphibians. Despite the promising results on its antioxidant activity and low cytotoxicity, the mechanisms of action of BmT-2 still need to be further elucidated.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","","Animals; Antioxidants; Bothrops; Crotalid Venoms; Humans; Neuroblastoma; Neuroprotective Agents; Peptides; Snake Venoms; alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; aromatic compound; arsenic trioxide; ascorbic acid; bmt 2; carnosine; DNA; fluorescein; free radical; glutathione; glycylhistidyllysine; melatonin; neuroprotective agent; peptide; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; salamandrin I; snake venom; transcription factor Nrf2; trolox C; tryptophyllin; unclassified drug; 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane); antioxidant; neuroprotective agent; peptide; snake venom; ABTS radical scavenging assay; antioxidant activity; Article; Bothrops; Bothrops moojeni; cell viability; computer model; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug isolation; drug structure; drug synthesis; erythrocyte; hemolysis; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; in vitro study; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; molecular dynamics; Neuro-2a cell line; neuroprotection; ORAC assay; oxidative stress; peptide synthesis; SK-N-BE(2) cell line; upregulation; animal; chemistry; neuroblastoma","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143988068"

Despite the phylogenetic diversity of animals in which POS has been described, most studies focus on animals under controlled laboratory conditions. To address this limitation, we have recently assessed the redox metabolism in the skeletal muscle of Proceratophrys cristiceps estivating under natural settings in the Caatinga. Here, we analyzed biochemical biomarkers in the muscle of another Caatinga species, Pleurodema diplolister, during the rainy (active) and dry (estivating frogs) seasons. We aimed to determine whether P. diplolister enhances its antioxidants during estivation under field conditions and to identify any effect of species on the biochemical responses of P. diplolister and P. cristiceps associated with estivation. To do so, we measured the activities of representative enzymes of intermediary metabolism and antioxidant systems, as well as glutathione and protein carbonyl levels, in the skeletal muscle of P. diplolister. Our findings revealed the suppression of oxidative metabolism and activation of antioxidant enzymes in estivating P. diplolister compared with active specimens. No changes in oxidative damage to proteins were observed and estivating P. diplolister had lower levels of disulfide glutathione (GSSG) and disulfide-to-total glutathione ratio (GSSG/tGSH) than those observed in active individuals. When data for P. diplolister and P. cristiceps were assembled and analyzed, significant effects of species were detected on the activities of metabolic enzymes (citrate synthase, isocitric dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and creatine kinase) and antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase), as well as on GSSG/tGSH ratio. Such effects might underlie the physiological and behavioral differences between these two species that share the same microhabitat and survival strategy (i.e., to estivate) during the dry season. Despite some peculiarities, which reflect the physiological diversity of the mechanisms associated with estivation in the Brazilian Caatinga, both P. diplolister and P. cristiceps seem to balance the suppression of oxidative pathways, the maintenance of the capacity of oxygen-independent pathways, and the activation of endogenous antioxidants to preserve muscle function and be ready to resume activity whenever the unpredictable rainy period arrives.

Because of its widespread, the limitations and advantages of the Bradford assay have been exhaustively reported, including several modifications of the original method to improve its performance. One of the alterations of the original method is the use of a smartphone camera as an analytical instrument. Taking advantage of the three forms of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye that exist in the conditions of the Bradford assay, this paper describes how to accurately quantify protein in samples using color data extracted from a single picture of a microplate. After performing the assay in a microplate, a picture is taken using a smartphone camera, and RGB color data is extracted from the picture using a free and open-source image analysis software application. Then, the ratio of blue to green intensity (in the RGB scale) of samples with unknown concentrations of protein is used to calculate the protein content based on a standard curve.

The identity of the mobilized antioxidant is often context-dependent and differs among species, tissues, and stresses. Thus, the contribution of individual antioxidants to the adaptation to oxygen deprivation remains elusive. This study investigated the role of glutathione (GSH) in the control of redox homeostasis under the stress of anoxia and reoxygenation in Helix aspersa, an animal model of anoxia tolerance. To do so, the total GSH (tGSH) pool was depleted with l-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO) before exposing snails to anoxia for 6 h. Then, the concentration of GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and oxidative stress markers (TBARS and protein carbonyl) and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) were measured in foot muscle and hepatopancreas. BSO alone induced tGSH depletion by 59–75%, but no other changes happened in other variables, except for foot GSSG. Anoxia elicited a 110–114% increase in glutathione peroxidase in the foot; no other changes occurred during anoxia. However, GSH depletion before anoxia increased the GSSG/tGSH ratio by 84–90% in both tissues, which returned to baseline levels during reoxygenation. Our findings indicate that glutathione is required to withstand the oxidative challenge induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation in land snails. © 2023 by the authors.","hypoxia; ischemia; preparation for oxidative stress; reoxygenation; reperfusion","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163887376"

In the case of ellagic acid (EA), there is evidence that it has free radical scavenger properties and that it is able to form complexes with metal ions. However, information on a possible link between the formation of iron-EA complexes and their interference in Haber-Weiss/Fenton reactions was not yet determined. Thus, the present study investigated the in vitro antioxidant mechanism of EA in a system containing ascorbate, Fe(III) and different iron ligands (EDTA, citrate and NTA). Iron-mediated oxidative degradation of 2-deoxyribose was poorly inhibited (by 12%) in the presence of EA (50 μM) and EDTA. When citrate or NTA - which form weak iron complexes - were used, the 2-deoxyribose protection increased to 89–97% and 45%, respectively. EA also presented equivalent inhibitory effects on iron-mediated oxygen uptake and ascorbyl radical formation. Spectral analyses of iron-EA complexes show that EA removes Fe(III) from EDTA within hours, and from citrate within 1 min. This difference in the rate of iron-EA complex formation may explain the antioxidant effects of EA. Furthermore, the EA antioxidant effectiveness was inversely proportional to the Fe(III) concentration, suggesting a competition with EDTA. In conclusion, the results indicate that EA may prevent in vitro free radical formation when it forms a complex with iron ions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidant; Ellagic acid; Free radical; Iron; Polyphenol","Antioxidants; Ellagic acid; Free radicals; Iron; Iron analysis; Metal ions; Metals; Spectrum analysis; Antioxidant effect; Antioxidant mechanisms; Antioxidant properties; Complex formations; Free radical scavengers; Inhibitory effect; Oxidative degradation; Polyphenols; Iron compounds","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994834801"

The complex glandular system of frog skin plays a pivotal role in enabling these animals to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and consists of crucial functions such as respiration and water balance as well as serving as a defensive barrier due to the secretion of bioactive compounds. We herein report the first investigation on the skin secretion of Odontophrynus americanus, as a potential source of bioactive peptides and also as an indicator of its evolutionary adaptations to changing environments. Americanin-1 was isolated and identified as a neutral peptide exhibiting moderate antibacterial activity against E. coli. Its amphipathic sequence including 19 amino acids and showing a propensity for α-helix structure is discussed. Comparisons of the histomorphology of the skin of O. americanus with other previously documented species within the same genus revealed distinctive features in the Patagonian specimen, differing from conspecifics from other Argentine provinces. The presence of the Eberth-Katschenko layer, a prevalence of iridophores, and the existence of glycoconjugates in its serous glands suggest that the integument is adapted to retain skin moisture. This adaptation is consistent with the prevailing aridity of its native habitat. © 2024 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.","","Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimicrobial Peptides; Anura; Argentina; Escherichia coli; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Structure; Peptides; Skin; antiinfective agent; peptide; polypeptide antibiotic agent; amino acid sequence; animal; Anura; Argentina; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effect; Escherichia coli; microbial sensitivity test; skin","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196632360"

This response has been described for more than 80 animal species belonging to eight phyla during hypometabolism or situations that limit oxygen availability. The pattern of the typical POS-response, in which a mild redox imbalance triggers antioxidant adjustments that results in increased tolerance to subsequent oxidative insults, roughly follows the curve of hormetic phenomena. A similar pattern has been reported for various animal species exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) – these studies, on animals from six phyla, are discussed herein. In the light of the similarities in the redox-response of animals exposed to either oxygen restriction or UVR, we argue in this essay that UVR elicits a type of response that fits the POS theory. Exposure to UVR induces both reactive species formation and antioxidant adaptation, which is the essence of typical POS-responses. Thus, antioxidant response to UVR in animals can be categorized as a POS-type mechanism. Moreover, considering that animals are exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously in nature, this would represent an ecologically relevant process, by which one stressor (e.g., UV or ionizing radiation) may enhance the tolerance to other. We also discuss a possible role of low doses of ionizing radiation as inductor of POS-like responses in animals. © 2019","Aquatic animals; Electromagnetic; Free radical; Glutathione; Hormesis; Wavelength","Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Antioxidants; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Stress, Physiological; Ultraviolet Rays; oxygen; antioxidant; controlled study; ionizing radiation; mitochondrion; nonhuman; Note; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; radiation dose; redox stress; reoxygenation; ultraviolet radiation; adaptation; adverse event; animal; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; physiological stress; radiation response; ultraviolet radiation","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073749113"

Therefore, animals living in marine, estuarine and freshwater environments have developed efficient antioxidant defenses to minimize oxidative stress and to regulate the cellular actions of ROS. Changes in oxygen levels may lead to bursts of ROS generation that can be particularly harmful. This situation is commonly experienced by aquatic animals during abrupt transitions from periods of hypoxia/anoxia back to oxygenated conditions (e.g. intertidal cycles). The strategies developed differ significantly among aquatic species and are (i) improvement of their endogenous antioxidant system under hyperoxia (that leads to increased ROS formation) or other similar ROS-related stresses, (ii) increase in antioxidant levels when displaying higher metabolic rates, (iii) presence of constitutively high levels of antioxidants, that attenuates oxidative stress derived from fluctuations in oxygen availability, or (iv) increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (and/or the levels of their mRNAs) during hypometabolic states associated with anoxia/hypoxia. This enhancement of the antioxidant system - coined over a decade ago as ""preparation for oxidative stress"" - controls the possible harmful effects of increased ROS formation during hypoxia/reoxygenation. The present article proposes a novel explanation for the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon that could be triggered by hypoxia-induced ROS formation. We also discuss the connections among oxygen sensing, oxidative damage and regulation of the endogenous antioxidant defense apparatus in animals adapted to many natural or man-made challenges of the aquatic environment. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Anoxia; Antioxidants; Hypoxia; Oxidative stress; Oxygen sensing","Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Antioxidants; Environment; Humans; Hydrobiology; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Reactive Oxygen Species; Respiration; Animalia; antioxidant; free radical; hypoxia inducible factor 1; messenger RNA; oxygen; protein p53; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor Nrf2; oxygen; reactive oxygen metabolite; antioxidant; reactive oxygen metabolite; adaptation; anoxia; antioxidant activity; aquatic environment; aquatic species; bioavailability; hypoxia; metabolic rate; nitrogen availability; nonhuman; oxidative stress; oxygen sensing; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; reoxygenation; review; animal; biology; breathing; environment; human; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; metabolism","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891613757"

Here, we report the structural characterization and antioxidant properties of a novel tryptophyllin-like peptide, named PpT-2, isolated from the Iberian green frog Pelophylax perezi. The skin secretion of P. perezi was obtained by electrical stimulation and fractionated using RP-HPLC. De novo peptide sequencing was conducted using MALDI MS/MS. The primary structure of PpT-2 (FPWLLS-NH2) was confirmed by Edman degradation and subsequently investigated using in silico tools. PpT-2 shared physicochemical properties with other well-known antioxidants. To test PpT-2 for antioxidant activity in vitro, the peptide was synthesized by solid phase and assessed in the chemical-based ABTS and DPPH scavenging assays. Then, a flow cytometry experiment was conducted to assess PpT-2 antioxidant activity in oxidatively challenged murine microglial cells. As predicted by the in silico analyses, PpT-2 scavenged free radicals in vitro and suppressed the generation of reactive species in PMA-stimulated BV-2 microglia cells. We further explored possible bioactivities of PpT-2 against prostate cancer cells and bacteria, against which the peptide exerted a moderate antiproliferative effect and negligible antimicrobial activity. The biocompatibility of PpT-2 was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays and in vivo toxicity with Galleria mellonella. No toxicity was detected in cells treated with up to 512 µg/ml and in G. mellonella treated with up to 40 mg/kg PpT-2.

This study aimed to isolate new bioactive compounds from B. caapi extract and evaluate their biological activity, and that of the known β-carboline components of the plant (harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine), in BV-2 microglial cells, the in vivo activation of which is implicated in the physiopathology of CNS disorders. B. caapi extract was fractionated using semipreparative liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) and the exact masses ([M + H]+ m/z) of the compounds in the 5 isolated fractions were determined by high-resolution LC-MS/MS: F1 (174.0918 and 233.1289), F2 (353.1722), F3 (304.3001), F4 (188.1081), and F5 (205.0785). Harmine (75.5–302 µM) significantly decreased cell viability after 2 h of treatment and increased the number of necrotic cells and production of reactive oxygen species at equal or lower concentrations after 24 h. F4 did not impact viability but was also cytotoxic after 24 h. Most treatments reduced proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, and/or TNF), especially harmaline and F5 at 2.5 µM and higher concentrations, tetrahydroharmine (9.3 µM and higher), and F5 (10.7 µM and higher). The results suggest that the compounds found in B. caapi extract have anti-inflammatory potential that could be explored for the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. © 2022 by the authors.

Neurodegeneration, the dysfunction and loss of neurons, is a hallmark of chronic (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease) and acute (e.g., stroke) pathological conditions for which current treatment is less than ideal. This has motivated the search for novel therapeutic agents, including peptide drugs. In the last years, peptides found in the skin secretion of amphibians have shown neuroprotective activity under experimental conditions. This chapter provides an overview of the studies that have investigated the neuroprotective potential of peptides isolated from the skin secretion of anurans. Six peptides, including two ocellatins and two tryptophyllins, originally found in the skin secretion of five anuran species are covered. The evidence for the neuroprotective activity of these peptides mainly stems from their ability to modulate microglia activation and the redox metabolism, key therapeutic targets for treatment of neurodegeneration. Other targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase-related signaling components, have also been investigated. Despite the necessity of further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action, as well as their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, peptides from the skin secretion of anurans hold promise as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Organisms adapted to these stressors often reduce their metabolic rates to maximize their chances of survival. However, upon recovery of environmental conditions and basal metabolic rates, cells are affected by an oxidative burst that, if uncontrolled, leads to (oxidative) cell damage and eventually death. Thus, a number of adapted organisms are able to increase their antioxidant defenses during an environmental/functional hypoxic transgression; a strategy that was interpreted in the 1990s as a “preparation for oxidative stress” (POS). Since that time, POS mechanisms have been identified in at least 83 animal species representing different phyla including Cnidaria, Nematoda, Annelida, Tardigrada, Echinodermata, Arthropoda, Mollusca and Chordata. Coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the postulation of the POS hypothesis, we compiled this review where we analyze a selection of examples of species showing POS-mechanisms and review the most recent advances in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms behind those strategies that allow animals to survive in harsh environments. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Aerial exposure; Dehydration; Estivation; Freezing; Hibernation; Hypoxia; Salinity stress","Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Annelida; Dehydration; Evolution, Molecular; Freezing; Hypoxia; Mollusca; Oxidative Stress; Salinity; enzyme; microRNA; transcription factor; adaptation; aestivation; animal model; anoxia; benthos; cold tolerance; ecophysiology; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental stress; environmental temperature; epigenetics; estuarine species; freezing; hibernation; hypoxia; intertidal species; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pelagic species; plankton; protein processing; regulatory mechanism; Review; RNA translation; salt stress; adverse event; animal; annelid; dehydration; genetics; hypoxia; metabolism; molecular evolution; mollusc; oxidative stress; physiology; salinity","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064690836"

Despite the expected implications on the endurance to extreme environments and ecosystem occupation, the extent to which POS occurs in animals under natural conditions remains unexplored. Therefore, we took advantage of the natural history of the Brazilian Caatinga's frog Proceratophrys cristiceps to investigate the modulation of endogenous antioxidants and redox balance in their skeletal muscle and to verify if POS occurs under natural conditions. Expectedly, estivating frogs had low levels of the oxidative metabolism enzymes. Citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities were 36% and 25% lower than those in active frogs respectively. We found an overall upregulation of antioxidants in estivating P. cristiceps. Reduced glutathione concentration was 61% higher in estivating frogs than that in active animals. During estivation the activities of the hydroperoxide detoxification enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione H2O2-peroxidase were 48%, 57%, and 78% greater than those during the rainy season. Moreover, estivating frogs had a 47% lower ratio of disulfide to total glutathione levels than active frogs. Our findings confirm the occurrence of ‘preparation for oxidative stress’ in naturally estivating frogs and paves the way for further research on the redox biology of animals under natural settings. Such approach might reveal biochemical strategies under ecologically relevant scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anuran; Caatinga; Glutathione; Metabolic depression; Reactive oxygen species; Redox balance","Animals; Antioxidants; Anura; Brazil; Ecosystem; Glutathione; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxidative Stress; Brazil; Animalia; Anura; Proceratophrys cristiceps; Animals; Antioxidants; Detoxification; Enzymes; Metabolism; Muscle; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species; Sulfur compounds; catalase; citrate synthase; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; isocitrate dehydrogenase; antioxidant; glutathione; hydrogen peroxide; Anuran; Caatinga; Glutathiones; Metabolic depression; Redox balances; antioxidant; enzyme activity; frog; metabolism; oxidative stress; reactive oxygen species; redox conditions; aerobic metabolism; aestivation; Anura; Article; controlled study; detoxification; enzyme activity; enzyme metabolism; microhabitat; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; priority journal; Proceratophrys cristiceps; rainy season; upregulation; animal; Anura; Brazil; ecosystem; oxidative stress; Peptides","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082102573"

In the last 25 years, researchers have been studying the role of redox metabolism in the survival machinery of animals under low oxygen stress and estivation.

Cathelicidins form a class of such molecules, which are produced by a variety of organisms. Batroxicidin (BatxC) is a cathelicidin found in the venom of the common lancehead (Bothrops atrox). In the present work, BatxC and two synthetic analogues, BatxC(C-2.15Phe) and BatxC(C-2.14Phe)des-Phe1, were assessed for their microbicidal activity. All three peptides showed a broad-spectrum activity on Gram-positive and-negative bacteria, as well as promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. Circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data indicated that the three peptides changed their structure upon interaction with membranes. Biomimetic membrane model studies demonstrated that the peptides exert a permeabilization effect in prokaryotic membranes, leading to cell morphology distortion, which was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The molecules considered in this work exhibited bactericidal and leishmanicidal activity at low concentrations, with the AFM data suggesting membrane pore formation as their mechanism of action.

This phenomenon was also observed during freezing exposure, severe dehydration, aerial exposure of water-breathing animals and estivation. However, as far as we know, there is no analysis available of the prevalence of POS among animal species. A major problem is the very definition of POS, since many animal species show both increases and decreases of antioxidants during low oxygen stress and estivation. Therefore, we established three different criteria; from inclusive to restrictive and analyzed how widespread the POS phenomenon is in the animal kingdom. We analyzed all available papers in several databases about the modulation of antioxidant defenses during oxygen deprivation or estivation. Based on the magnitude of change (as % change) during the specific low oxygen stresses or estivation, we classified each species as POS-positive, POS-negative or POS-neutral, considering the three different criteria. The prevalence of POS-positive animals (102 species from 8 phyla) was stress-dependent: in estivation and dehydration it was 91–100%, while in hypoxia it was 37.5–53%, depending on the criteria. In the case of air exposure, anoxia and freezing the proportions of POS-positive species were 54–77%, 64–77% and 75–86%, respectively. Overall, the prevalence of POS was 58 to 68% when all stresses and all species were analyzed together. The results indicate the key importance of POS as a survival strategy of animals exposed to freezing, dehydration and estivation, and, to a lesser extent, to oxygen deprivation itself (i.e. hypoxia and anoxia). © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Air exposure; Anoxia; Antioxidant; Dehydration; Estivation; Freezing; Glutathione; Hypoxia; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species","Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Antioxidants; Biodiversity; Data Mining; Enzymes; Freezing; Glutathione; Hypoxia; Oxidative Stress; antioxidant; catalase; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione transferase; manganese superoxide dismutase; metallothionein; oxygen; peroxiredoxin; selenium; selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; antioxidant; enzyme; glutathione; aestivation; Amphibia; animal experiment; animal model; annelid; anoxia; arthropod; Article; bivalve; cephalopod; Chordata; Cnidaria; controlled study; dehydration; echinoderm; environmental exposure; freezing; hypoxia; insect; molecular biology; mollusc; nematode; nonhuman; oxidative stress; prevalence; reptile; species composition; survival rate; Tardigrada; adaptation; animal; biodiversity; data mining; enzymology; hypoxia; metabolism; pathophysiology; veterinary medicine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958267889"

The growing occurrence of drug-resistant strains of Leishmania and severe side effects of available treatments represent an important challenge for the leishmaniases treatment. We have previously reported the leishmanicidal activity of phylloseptin-1 (PSN-1), a peptide found in the skin secretion of Phyllomedusa azurea (=Pithecopus azureus), against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes. However, its impact on the amastigote form of L. amazonensis and its impact on infected macrophages are unknown. In this work, we evaluated the effects of PSN-1 on amastigotes of L. amazonensis inside macrophages infected in vitro. We assessed the production of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, as well as the levels of inflammatory and immunomodulatory markers (TGF-β, TNF-α and IL-12), in infected and non-infected macrophages treated with PSN-1. Treatment with PSN-1 decreased the number of infected cells and the number of ingested amastigotes per cell when compared with the untreated cells. At 32 µM (64 µg/mL), PSN-1 reduced hydrogen peroxide levels in both infected and uninfected macrophages, whereas it had little effect on NO production or TGF-β release. The effect of PSN-1 on IL-12 and TNF-α secretion depended on its concentration, but, in general, their levels tended to increase as PSN-1 concentration increased. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of action of PSN-1 and its interaction with the immune system aiming to develop pharmacological applications. © 2020 by the authors.

The regulation of free radical metabolism seems to be crucial under these selective pressures, since this response is widespread among animals. A hypothesis of how POS works at the molecular level was recently proposed and relies on two main processes: increased reactive species production under hypoxia, and activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors and signaling pathways, increasing the expression of antioxidants. The present paper brings together the current knowledge on POS and considers its future directions. Data indicate the presence of POS in 83 animal species (71.6% among investigated species), distributed in eight animal phyla. Three main research challenges on POS are presented: (i) to identify the molecular mechanism(s) that mediate/induce POS, (ii) to identify the evolutionary origins of POS in animals, and (iii) to determine the presence of POS in natural environments. We firstly discuss the need of evidence for increased RS production in hypoxic conditions that underlie the POS response. Secondly, we discuss the phylogenetic origins of POS back 700 million years, by identifying POS-positive responses in cnidarians. Finally, we present the first reports of the POS adaptation strategy in the wild. The investigation of these research trends and challenges may prove useful to understand the evolution of animal redox adaptations and how they adapt to increasing stressful environments on Earth. © 2017 Moreira, Oliveira, Liz-Guimarães, Diniz-Rojas, Campos and Hermes-Lima.","Antioxidant; Biochemical adaptation; Estivation; Hypoxia; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species","reactive oxygen metabolite; adaptation; Article; evolution; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; phylogeny; prevalence; research; trend study; wilderness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030121921"

Here, we report a novel bombesin-like peptide isolated from Boana raniceps. Its amino acid sequence, GGNQWAIGHFM-NH2, was identified and structurally confirmed by HPLC, MS/MS and 454-pyrosequencing; the peptide was named BR-bombesin. The effect of BR-bombesin on smooth muscle contraction was assessed in ileum and esophagus, and its anti-secretory activity was investigated in the stomach. BR-bombesin exerted significant contractile activity with a concentration–response curve similar to that of commercially available bombesin in ileum strips of Wistar rats. In esophageal strips, BR-bombesin acted as an agonist, as many other bombesin-related peptides act, although with different behavior compared to the muscarinic agonist carbachol. Moreover, BR-bombesin inhibited stomach secretion by approximately 50% compared to the untreated control group. This novel peptide has 80% and 70% similarity with the 10-residue C-terminal domain of human neuromedin B (NMB) and human gastrin releasing peptide (GRP10), respectively. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the GRP receptor had a binding energy equal to − 7.3 kcal.mol−1 and − 8.5 kcal.mol−1 when interacting with bombesin and BR-bombesin, respectively. Taken together, our data open an avenue to investigate BR-bombesin in disorders that involve gastrointestinal tract motility and acid gastric secretion. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Amphibian; Bioactive peptide; Gastric secretion; Gastrin releasing peptide; Gastrointestinal activity; Neuromedin B","bombesin; carbachol; gastrin releasing peptide receptor; glycylglycylasparaginylglutaminyltryptophylalanylisoleucylglycylhistidinylphenylalanylmethionylamide; neuromedin B; neuromedin C; peptide derivative; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; Anura; Article; Boana raniceps; carboxy terminal sequence; concentration response; controlled study; drug activity; drug isolation; drug receptor binding; drug structure; esophagus; gastrointestinal motility; high performance liquid chromatography; ileum; molecular docking; nonhuman; protein domain; pyrosequencing; rat; stomach acid secretion; stomach secretion; tandem mass spectrometry; Wistar rat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126267666"

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα/γ/δ) are fatty acid sensors that help mitigate imbalances between energy uptake and utilization. Herein, we report compounds derived from phenolic lipids present in cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), an abundant waste byproduct, in an effort to create effective, accessible, and sustainable drugs. Derivatives of anacardic acid and cardanol were tested for PPAR activity in HEK293 cell co-transfection assays, primary hepatocytes, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In vivo studies using PPAR-expressing zebrafish embryos identified CNSL derivatives with varying tissue-specific activities. LDT409 (23) is an analogue of cardanol with partial agonist activity for PPARα and PPARγ. Pharmacokinetic profiling showed that 23 is orally bioavailable with a half-life of 4 h in mice. CNSL derivatives represent a sustainable source of selective PPAR modulators with balanced intermediate affinities (EC50 ∼100 nM to 10 μM) that provide distinct and favorable gene activation profiles for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","","3T3-L1 Cells; Anacardic Acids; Anacardium; Animals; Drug Design; Gene Expression; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molecular Docking Simulation; Nuts; PPAR alpha; PPAR delta; PPAR gamma; Protein Domains; Zebrafish; 1 methoxy 3 pentadecyl benzene; 2 (3 pentadecylphenoxy)acetic acid; 2 acetoxy 4 pentadecylbenzoic acid; 2 acetoxy 6 pentadecylbenzoic acid; 2 hydroxy 4 pentadecylbenzoic acid; 2 hydroxy 6 pentadecylbenzoic acid; 2 methoxy 4 pentadecylbenzaldehyde; 2 methoxy 4 pentadecylbenzoic acid; 2 methoxy 6 pentadecylbenzoic acid; 2 methyl 2 (3 pentadecylphenoxy)ethyl propanoate; 2 methyl 2 (3 pentadecylphenoxy)propanoic acid; 2 methyl 2 [3 (pentadec 8 en 1 yl)phenoxy]propanoic acid; 2 [3 (pentadec 8 en 1 yl)phenoxy]acetic acid; 2 [4 [2 [3 cyclohexyl 1 (4 cyclohexylbutyl)ureido]ethyl]phenylthio] 2 methylpropionic acid; 3 pentadecylphenol; 3 pentadecylphenol acetate; anacardic acid; anacardic acid derivative; cardanol derivative; CD36 antigen; ethyl 2 (3 pentadecylphenoxy)acetate; ethyl 2 methyl 2 [3 (pentadec 8 en 1 yl)phenoxy]propanoate; ethyl 2 [3 (pentadec 8 en 1 yl)phenoxy]acetate; fatty acid binding protein; fatty acid binding protein 1; ldt 10; ldt 11; ldt 12; ldt 13; ldt 15; ldt 16; ldt 208; ldt 220; ldt 27; ldt 28; ldt 30; ldt 380; ldt 381; ldt 383; ldt 384; ldt 407; ldt 408; ldt 409; ldt 486a; ldt 487a; ldt 539a; ldt 540a; lipid; messenger RNA; methyl 2 acetoxy 6 pentadecylbenzoate; methyl 2 hydroxy 4 pentadecylbenzoate; methyl 2 methoxy 4 pentadecylbenzoate; methyl 2 methoxy 6 pentadecylbenzoate; muraglitazar; natural product; partial agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phenol derivative; pirinixic acid; pyruvate dehydrogenase; pyruvate dehydrogenase 4; rosiglitazone; stearic acid; unclassified drug; [4 [2 (3 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl) 4 methyl 5 thiazolylmethylthio] 2 methylphenoxy]acetic acid; anacardic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; area under the curve; Article; binding affinity; binding site; biological activity; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cashew nut; cell differentiation; concentration response; controlled study; crystal structure; drug bioavailability; drug design; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug receptor binding; drug screening; drug structure; drug synthesis; drug targeting; EC50; elimination rate constant; embryo; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; gene expression; genetic transfection; half life time; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; ligand binding; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver cell; liver microsome; male; maximum concentration; maximum drug effect; metabolic disorder; metabolic stability; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular recognition; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; nutshell (structure); protein expression; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; regulatory mechanism; single drug dose; structure activity relation; time to maximum plasma concentration; tissue distribution; upregulation; zebra fish; Anacardium; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; nut; protein domain; synthesis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124327295"

In contrast, several hypoxia/anoxia-tolerant animals survive very similar situations. We evaluated herein the redox metabolism in the anoxia-tolerant land snail Helix aspersa after catalase inhibition by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) injection during a cycle of wide and abrupt change in oxygen availability. The exposure to anoxia for 5 h caused a change of only one of several parameters related to free radical metabolism: a rise in selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPX) activity in muscle of both saline- and ATZ-injected animals (by 1.9- and 1.8-fold, respectively). Catalase suppression had no effect in animals under normoxia or anoxia. However, during reoxygenation catalase suppression kept high levels of muscle Se-GPX activity (twofold higher than in saline-injected snails up to 30 min reoxygenation) and induced the increase in hepatopancreas SOD activity (by 22 %), indicating higher levels of ROS in both organs than in saline-injected animals. Additionally, catalase-suppressed snails showed 12 % higher levels of carbonyl protein—a sign of mild oxidative stress—in muscle during reoxygenation than those animals with intact catalase. No changes were observed in glutathione parameters (GSH, GSSG and GSSG:GSH ratio), TBARS, and GST activity in any of the experimental groups, in both organs. These results indicate that catalase inhibition inflicts changes in the free radical metabolism during reoxygenation, prompting a stress-response that is a reorganization in other enzymatic antioxidant defenses to minimize alterations in the redox homeostasis in land snails. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Free radicals; Glutathione; Hypoxia; Ischemia; Oxidative damage","Amitrole; Animals; Arthropod Proteins; Catalase; Glutathione Peroxidase; Hypoxia; Muscles; Oxygen; Snails; amitrole; arthropod protein; catalase; glutathione peroxidase; oxygen; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; hypoxia; metabolism; muscle; snail","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964050185"

In contrast to controlled laboratory settings, animals are exposed to multiple abiotic stressors under natural field conditions. Still, the interplay between different environmental factors in modulating redox metabolism in natural settings remains largely unexplored. Here, we aim to shed light on this topic by assessing changes in redox metabolism in the mussel Brachidontes solisianus naturally exposed to a tidal cycle. We compared the redox biochemical response of mussels under six different natural conditions in the field along two consecutive days. These conditions differ in terms of chronology, immersion/emersion, and solar radiation, but not in terms of temperature. Animals were collected after being exposed to air early morning (7:30), immersed during late morning and afternoon (8:45-15:30), and then exposed to air again late afternoon towards evening (17:45-21:25), in two days. Whole body homogenates were used to measure the activity of antioxidant (catalase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase) and metabolic (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase) enzymes, reduced (GSH) and disulfide (GSSG) glutathione levels, and oxidative stress markers (protein carbonyl and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances). Air and water temperature remained stable between 22.5 ◦C and 26 ◦C during both days. Global solar radiation (GSR) greatly differed between days, with a cumulative GSR of 15,381 kJ/m2 for day 1 and 5,489 kJ/m2 for day 2, whose peaks were 2,240 kJ/m2/h at 14:00 on day 1 and 952 kJ/m2/h at 12:00 on day 2. Compared with animals underwater, emersion during early morning did not elicit any alteration in redox biomarkers in both days. Air exposure for 4 h in the late afternoon towards evening caused oxidative damage to proteins and lipids and elicited GSH synthesis in animals that had been previously exposed to high GSR during the day. In the following day, when GSR was much lower, exposure to air under the same conditions (duration, time, and temperature) had no effect on any redox biomarker. These findings suggest that air exposure under low-intensity solar radiation is not sufficient to trigger POS in B. solisianus in its natural habitat. Thus, natural UV radiation is possibly a key environmental factor that combined to air exposure induces the POS-response to the stressful event of tidal variation in this coastal species.

An increase in oxidative damage occurred in the hatchling-juvenile transition (but not in the juvenile-adult transition) and winter-summer transition (in juveniles), suggesting that oxidative stress is associated with development and season. Herein the effect of development and season on glutathione (GSH) metabolism and the effect of development on the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase) and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were analyzed. The ratio GSSG:GSH-eq increased in lung, liver, kidney and brain by 1.8- to 4-fold in the embryo/hatchling to juvenile transition. No changes occurred in juvenile-adult transition. GSSG:GSH-eq across seasons was significantly elevated in summer. Total-glutathione content was mostly stable in various organs; in liver it increased in the embryo-juvenile transition. Enzyme activities were only determined in summer-animals (embryos, hatchlings and juveniles). For most antioxidant enzymes, activities increased from embryo/hatchling to juvenile in liver and Kidney. In lung, there was an inverse trend for enzyme activities and total glutathione content. Thus, increased metabolic rates during early caiman growth - in embryo-juvenile transition - appears to be related to redox imbalance as suggested by increased GSSG:GSH-eq and activation of antioxidant defenses. Differences in oxidative stress across seasons were related with summer-winter nocturnal temperatures. These results, as a whole, were interpreted in the context of ecological biochemistry. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Antioxidant; Caiman yacare; Development; Glutathione; Oxidative stress","Animalia; Caiman; Caiman yacare; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); catalase; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; glutathione transferase; adolescent; animal tissue; article; brain; crocodilian; embryo; enzyme activity; glutathione metabolism; kidney; liver; lung; nonhuman; tissue level","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864087578"

Such conditions include, for example, lack of food and/or water, low or high temperatures, and reduced oxygen availability. In contrast to an expected strong suppression of protein synthesis, a great number of these animals present increased levels of antioxidant defenses during oxygen deprivation. These observations have puzzled researchers for more than 20 years. Initially, two predominant ideas seemed to be irreconcilable: on one hand, hypoxia would decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, while on the other the induction of antioxidant enzymes would require the overproduction of ROS. This induction of antioxidant enzymes during hypoxia was viewed as a way to prepare animals for oxidative damage that may happen ultimately during reoxygenation. The term preparation for oxidative stress (POS) was coined in 1998 based on such premise. However, there are many cases of increased oxidative damage in several hypoxia-tolerant organisms under hypoxia. In addition, over the years, the idea of an assured decrease in ROS formation under hypoxia was challenged. Instead, several findings indicate that the production of ROS actually increases in response to hypoxia. Recently, it became possible to provide a comprehensive explanation for the induction of antioxidant enzymes under hypoxia. The supporting evidence and the limitations of the POS idea are extensively explored in this review as we discuss results from research on estivation and situations of low oxygen stress, such as hypoxia, freezing exposure, severe dehydration, and air exposure of water-breathing animals. We propose that, under some level of oxygen deprivation, ROS are overproduced and induce changes leading to hypoxic biochemical responses. These responses would occur mainly through the activation of specific transcription factors (FoxO, Nrf2, HIF-1, NF-κB, and p53) and post translational mechanisms, both mechanisms leading to enhanced antioxidant defenses. Moreover, reactive nitrogen species are candidate modulators of ROS generation in this scenario. We conclude by drawing out the future perspectives in this field of research, and how advances in the knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the POS strategy will offer new and innovative study scenarios of biological and physiological cellular responses to environmental stress. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Anoxia; Dehydration; Estivation; Freeze tolerance; Hypoxia tolerance; Ischemia","Animals; Humans; Hypoxia; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Oxidative Stress; antioxidant; enzyme; free radical; lipid; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor; aestivation; anoxia; dehydration; environmental stress; freezing; high temperature; hypoxia; lipid peroxidation; metabolic inhibition; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein synthesis; Review; animal; human; hypoxia; metabolism; pathophysiology","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946593511"

However, little is known about the biochemical changes associated with the diapause phenotype in tropical insects. To investigate biochemical adaptations associated with tropical diapause, we measured the activities of metabolic and antioxidant enzymes, as well as glutathione levels, in the sunflower caterpillar Chlosyne lacinia at different times after initiation of diapause (<1, 20, 40, 60, and 120 days) and after arousal from diapause. Biochemical changes occurred early in diapausing animals, between the first 24 h and 20 days of diapause. Diapausing animals had reduced oxidative capacity associated with a decrease in the activities of peroxide-decomposing antioxidant enzymes. There was no sign of redox imbalance either during diapause or after recovery from diapause. Noteworthy, glutathione transferase and isocitrate dehydrogenase-NADP+ activities sharply increased in diapausing animals and stand out as diapause-associated proteins. The upregulation of these two enzymes ultimately indicate the occurrence of Preparation for Oxidative Stress in the tropical diapause of C. lacinia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Glutathione; Glutathione transferase; Isocitrate dehydrogenase; Metabolic depression; NADPH; Preparation for oxidative stress","Animals; Antioxidants; Butterflies; Diapause, Insect; Glutathione; Glutathione Transferase; Insect Proteins; Larva; NADP; Oxidative Stress; antioxidant; glutathione; glutathione transferase; insect protein; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; animal; butterfly; diapause; larva; metabolism; oxidative stress; physiology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104917379"
